🌍 Overview

Sign Language Translator is an AI-powered application designed to translate sign language gestures into text and speech in real time — breaking communication barriers for the hearing and speech-impaired community.
This project integrates Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing to create an accessible, inclusive, and human-centered communication tool.


🚀 Key Features

🧠 Real-Time Gesture Detection – Detects and interprets hand gestures using a webcam or external camera feed.

🔊 Text-to-Speech Conversion – Converts recognized gestures into spoken words for effective two-way communication.

💬 Continuous Gesture Prediction – Tracks sequences of signs to form complete sentences.

📱 User-Friendly Interface – Clean, responsive UI for effortless interaction and accessibility.

🌐 Multilingual Support (Optional) – Can be extended to translate into multiple spoken languages.

💡 Custom Model Training – Supports training with new gestures or regional sign variations.

⚙️ How It Works

Gesture Input: User performs sign gestures in front of the camera.

Frame Capture: Each frame is processed using MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks.

Feature Extraction: The model extracts coordinates and movement patterns.

Prediction: A trained CNN model classifies gestures into corresponding letters or words.

Output: The system displays the translated text and optionally converts it into speech.

🧠 Model Architecture

Input: Hand landmark points (x, y coordinates)

Hidden Layers: 3 Convolutional layers + Batch Normalization + Dropout

Output: Predicted gesture class (A-Z / Words)

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy

💻 Installation & Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-translator.git
cd sign-language-translator

Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Application
python app.py

Step 4: Start Signing!

Your camera will open automatically. Perform gestures and watch them get translated into text and speech instantly.
